        <h1>Chocolat Chip Cookies (Bakery-style)</h1>
        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>
            These Bakery Style Chocolate Chip Cookies are thick, crisp on the outside, soft and gooey on the inside and filled with chocolate chips and chocolate chunks!
        </p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>227g Danish Creamery Premium Sea Salted Butter, cold</li>
            <li>150g light brown sugar, lightly packed</li>
            <li>100g granulated sugar</li>
            <li>2 tsp vanilla bean paste</li>
            <li>1 large egg, room temperature</li>
            <li>240g all-purpose flour, spooned and leveled</li>
            <li>2 tsp baking powder</li>
            <li>170g chopped dark chocolate</li>
            <li>170g milk chocolate chips</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Cube the butter and place half in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment. Brown the other half of the butter and then pour it over the cold, cubed butter. Let it rest for 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add the brown sugar and granulated sugar and turn the mixer up to medium speed and beat for 3-4 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add the vanilla and the egg and beat at medium-high speed for 2-3 minutes, until the mixture is pale.</li>
            <li>Add the flour and baking powder and mix, on low speed, just until there’s only a few streaks of flour left. Fold in the chocolate just until it’s evenly dispersed.</li>
            <li>Refrigerate the dough for 30 minutes and then separate the dough into ten, 113g cookie rounds. Make sure to roll them into balls, don’t just scoop them or you’ll get uneven sides. Refrigerate the cookie dough rounds for at least an hour or up to overnight.</li>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 177C convection (conventional/no fan also works at 163C +1-2 minutes, but I recommend convection if you have it).</li>
            <li>Bake the 113g cookies for 13-14 minutes, until the edges are browned and the center is puffed and no longer looks wet.</li>
            <li>Remove from the oven, tap the tray on the counter and top with a few extra chocolate chips and a pinch of sea salt. Let the cookies rest on the pan for 10 minutes.</li>
        </ol>

            <h5>Notes</h5>
            <p>Leave the cookie butter as thick globs but just cover it up with the brownie batter a little so the cookie butter isn't as directly exposed to the heat of the oven.</p>
            <p>Store in an airtight container at room temperature for 2-3 days.</p>
