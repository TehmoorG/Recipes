        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>900 grams of cream cheese</li>
            <li>400 grams of granulated sugar</li>
            <li>7 eggs</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon of table salt</li>
            <li>240 milliliters of heavy cream</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 260 °C. Line a 25 cm springform pan with 2 sheets of parchment paper, leaving a 5 cm border of paper extending from the top of the pan. The paper will not lie flat against the pan, this is ok.</li>
            <li>Place the cheese and sugar in the bowl of a food processor. Pulse a few times to combine the ingredients. Add the eggs, salt, and cream. Process the batter for 3 minutes to completely emulsify the batter. If you don't have a food processor the batter can be mixed in a stand or hand mixer. Just be sure to mix the batter until very smooth and glossy.</li>
            <li>Pour the batter into the prepared pan and immediately place it in the oven. Bake until the top of cheesecake is very dark brown and the sides of the cake are risen-up and set, about 25 minutes. The center of the cake will still be quite soft and will jiggle like a liquid if you shake the pan.</li>
            <li>Remove the cake from the oven and cool to room temperature on a cooling rack. Refrigerate the cake until completely chilled, at least 4 hours. The cake will be soft and fluffy around the edges and custardy in the center. The center will be set just enough to slice.</li>
        </ol>
