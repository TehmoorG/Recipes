        <h1>Biscoff Brownies</h1>
        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>
            The ultimate biscoff brownies are the perfect fudge-y brownies sitting on top of biscoff cookies and with globs of creamy Biscoff cookie butter swirled throughout. 
        </p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>15 Lotus Biscoff Cookies</li>
            <li>3/4 cup (170g) unsalted butter</li>
            <li>1 cup (6 oz) 170g semi-sweet chocolate morsels</li>
            <li>4 large eggs, room temperature</li>
            <li>1 cup (200g) granulated sugar</li>
            <li>1/2 cup (95g) light brown sugar, lightly packed</li>
            <li>1 tsp vanilla extract</li>
            <li>1 cup (120g) all-purpose flour, spooned and leveled</li>
            <li>1/4 cup (25g) Dutch-process cocoa powder, spooned and leveled</li>
            <li>1/4 cup (30g or 4 cookies) Lotus Biscoff cookies, ground</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp salt</li>
            <li>1/2 cup (120g) Lotus Biscoff Cookie Butter</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 325F/163C convection (300F/149C conventional). Use cooking spray and parchment paper to grease and line an 8-inch square pan.</li>
            <li>Align the Biscoff cookies along the bottom of the pan and set aside.</li>
            <li>In a heat-safe bowl or a saucepan, melt the butter with the semi-sweet chocolate. Set them aside to cool while you get the rest of the ingredients together.</li>
            <li>Use a whisk to combine the eggs, granulated sugar, brown sugar, and vanilla until they're just barely combined; don't over-mix.</li>
            <li>Slowly pour in the butter and chocolate mixture to the eggs and sugar, while whisking.</li>
            <li>Add the flour, cocoa powder, ground Biscoff cookies, and salt to the batter and fold them together until they're just barely combined.</li>
            <li>Pour the brownie batter into the prepared pan. Place quarter-sized globs of cookie butter on top and use a knife to gently swirl them into the brownie batter a little. Bake for about 45 minutes.</li>
            <li>Remove the brownies from the oven and allow them to cool in the pan for about 30-60 minutes, until they can be sliced without falling apart.</li>
        </ol>
        <div class="note">
            <h5>Notes</h5>
            <p>Leave the cookie butter as thick globs but just cover it up with the brownie batter a little so the cookie butter isn't as directly exposed to the heat of the oven.</p>
            <p>Store in an airtight container at room temperature for 2-3 days.</p>
